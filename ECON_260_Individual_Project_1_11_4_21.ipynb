        "\n",
        "In 2020, the global pandemic of Covid-19 resulted in many people losing their jobs and becoming unemployed. Due to the large majority of unemployment, the government assigned stimulus checks to all citizens who lost their job and were unemployed due to Covid-19 related reasons. The purpose of the stimulus check was to be able to provide people with enough money in order to sustain themselves during the pandemic. Since people had to rely on their income via the stimulus check, many citizens needed to learn how to carefully budget their money. Consumers needed to decided how much of their money they should spend on essentials versus leisure. \n",
        "\n",
        "In this model, we will take a closer look on how consumers maximize their utility of the two things as well as how they minimize their costs. We will explore two different scenarios, one where the consumer is favoring essentials and leisure equally, and one situation where the consumer prioritizes spending their money on essentials only. \n",
        "\n",
        "There will be two functions we explore, one *Constant Elasticity of Substitution* (CES) function and one *Cobb-Douglas* (CD) function. In both scenarios, we will assume that we are looking at *one* consumers choice. For the CES function, the consumer favors essentials and leisure equally. However, for the CD function, the consumer changes their mind and only prioritizes essentials over leisure. \n",
        "\n",
        "We are exploring the different comparisons between spending money strictly on essentials or spending money on both essentials and leisure. This is because, although it may seem appealing to only spend money on essentials and save the rest, there is also a marginal utility that should be explored in regards to the relationship between leisure and essentials. Splitting money between essentials and leisure may result in consumer's having a smaller supply of essentials and needing to use the essentials more scarely. However, with spending less money on essentials, it allows the consumer's more room to spend money on leisure items like online shopping and more. With perks like television subscriptions and online shopping, splitting the budget between essentials and leisure may result in a higher marginal utility because the consumer will be more happy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the models, essentials will be represented with *p1* & *q1* and leisure will be represented by *p2* & *q2*. *Y* will represent the stimulus check/the consumer's income. The value *0.4* is serving as our alpha, which is a parameter for how the function is defined. Finally, *U* will represent utilty. \n",

        "For our first model, we will be looking at a constant elasticity utility function (CES). "

The optimal quantity of essentials will increase because consumers will be saving money by buying more essentials which will make them feel happier and more satisfied with the product. Finally, if U increases, the optimal quantity of essentials increases. This makes sense because if the overall satisfaction of consumers increases, then the optimal quantity of essentials is also going to increase by default. \n",

        "The CD function is useful because it can be fitted to time series analysis and cross section anaylsis. Additionally, when looking at the function graphically, since it is a linear function, we are able to clearly see what is happening in the function. \n",

        "On the other hand there are some limitations to the CD function. First of all, the function only includes two factors and neglects all other inputs. This means, when the price changes in one good, the CD function does not include any information about the change in quantity of another good. \n"

        "Overall, the optimal consumption bundle changes depending on if you use CES or CD. From the model, we can see with the CES function, when the consumer has the same elasticity of demand for both products, the consumer will purchase the same amount of leisure and essentials to get their optimal utility. However, in the CD function, when the consumer prefers essentials, the consumer is more likely to buy a greater quantity of essentials to minimize their cost unless the price of essentials increases. With the CD, if the cost increases, then they will decrease their consumption of essentials slightly and instead increase their consumption of leisure. \n",

        "With CES, it demonstrates how to reach optimal utiltiy when you are trying to essentially balance two different items, in this case *essentials* and *leisure*. With CES, we are able to see how the consumer prioritizes essentials, but still also spends money on leisure. The CES function helps the consumer balance the two items to and to know how much of the budget to spend on each items to get the optimal utility. \n",
        "\n",
        "On the other hand, with the CD function, we focus on one item and try to interpret how much of the budget we should spend on the item until the marginal cost eventually becomes greater than the marginal utility. \n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, depending on the situation and scenario, both CES and CD have there pros and con. If you are trying to look at multiple variables, it is better to use CES; however, if you are trying to simply focus on one to two variables, it is better to use CD function. In the scenarios listed above, when trying to include and compare two goods, the CES function seemed to be more beneficial, but when only focusing on one, the CD seemed more detailed and helpful. With the CES function, you will find the optimal consumption bundle when comparing more than one good. With CD function, you will find the optimal consumption bundle when comparing and focusing in on one good. "
