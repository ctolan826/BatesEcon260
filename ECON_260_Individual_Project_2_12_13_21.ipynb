        "Freeport Maine is one of Maine's best and most well know shopping centers. While on vacation, many people visit Freeport to go shopping. In the shopping center, there are two stores that provide similar products. Both of the companies *Patagonia* and *LL Bean* sell similar products. \n",
        "\n",
        "With both clothing stores located in Maine, there is an especially high demand in winter coats than other store locations. This is because Maine is notorious for being a cold state and needing many layers and warm coats in the winter. Additionally, both companies guarantee high sustainability in all of their clothes and offer similar outdoor apparel like snow jackets. \n",
        "\n",
        "In the retail industry, on a weekly basis, clothing stores typically have set goals they want to achieve in how much of a product they intend to sell. More specifically, during holidays like Black Friday, Labor Day and Memorial Day weekend, and Christmas there are certain sale goals they try to make. In this scenario, we will be looking at how Patagonia and LL Bean chooses to stock their winter jacket inventory for Labor Day Weekend. With LL Bean and Patagonia being very close in proximity to each other in Freeport and offering similar things, both stores want to base their quanitity of apparel they order off of the quanity they expect their competitor to produce. \n",
        "\n",
        "In order to determine what quantity of winter jackets they want to produce, the two companies can use *Cournot's Model*. Cournot's model is a game theory model that helps determines the Nash Equilibrium in terms of quantity for two competing, profit maximizing firms. Using the Cournot's model, we can determine what the optimal quantities of both companies will be, given the expected quantity their competitor will be producing. \n",
        "\n",
        "Additionally, if we focus on the clothing quantity and sales from Labor Day weekend for Patagonia and LL Bean, in order to better understand the relationship between the two companies, we can use comparative statics and the market demand curve for winter coats. This will help us better understand where these optimal quantities and assumptions come from, and whether the two companies would likely continue to produce jackets at the same quantity during the other holidays. Understanding the relationship between optimal quantity and the demand and cost curves can help Patagonia and LL Bean determine if/when they should increase the quantity of winter jackets to produce. \n",
        "\n",
        "Using the Cournot's model will look into both Labor Day optimal quanitities for production at both Patagonia and LL Bean, as well as looking into how those optimal quanities have led to a shortage of winter coats for every big holiday in Freeport, Maine. The purpose of the study is to answer the following questions: \n",

This \"downwards spiral\" of both companies is the same conclusion you get from something called *Prisoner's dilemma* Prisoner's dilemma is when there are multiple individuals trying to make decisions and one individual ends up making a decision that essentially results in a less than optimal outcome for all parties involved. If Patagonia individually increases their stock of winter coats, it lowers the market price for winter coats, making LL Bean feel obligated to increase their stock in order to compensate for the price effect, and ultimately results in both companies losing profits from an increase in the quantity of coats they need to stock but a decrease in the market value of the winter coats.
